function sumShellVols = shellmethod2(funcString, shellcount, lowbound, upbound)
%SHELLMETHOD2 Returns the , the volume under a function retrieved by rotating the
% area under the function around the axis perpendicular to the axis of revolution. 
% The volume approaches the approximate volume as the number of shells increases.
%   Input:
%       1. Function
%       2. Number of shells encompassing the volume.
%       3. Lower bound of input variable.
%       4. Upper bound of input variable.

%   General steps:
%       1. Determine the delta based on bounds and number of shells, use
%       delta to get shell radii.
%       2. Generate shell heights(height of cylindert using function and radi
%       3. Generate each shell volume by multiplying shell heights, their 
%       radii and delta.
%       3. Add them together, multiply their sum by 2*pi.
